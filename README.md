This projects aim to build a solver for the board game from A Lif of Logic. The purpose of the project is to implement and visualize the backtracking algorithm/DFS.
The square board can only have 0 and 1 and need to follow three rules:
No three same numbers next to each other.
Each row and column must have the same number of 0 and 1
No identical rows or columns
